# Data-Visualization-in-python
Human brain can process information easily when it is in pictorial or graphical form ,therefore data visualisation is necessary.
Data visualisation  is done here by using numpy and matplotlib using easy and simple codes.
# Numpy-in-python
Numpy stands for Numerical python. It consists of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. It is the core library for numeric and scientific computing.
Numpy is better than list as it is less memory comzuming , fast and convient.

# Pandas-in-python
Pandas stands for Panel Data and is the core library for data manipulation and data analysis. It consists of single and multi-dimensional data structures for data manipulation. Series Object is one-dimensional labeled array. DataFrame is the multi-dimensional ,size-mutable, potentially heterogenous tabular data .

# Matplotlib.pyplot
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization library built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack. 
matplotlib.pyplot is a plotting library used for 2D graphics in python programming language. It can be used in python scripts, shell, web application servers and other graphical user interface toolkits.
# Seaborn-python
Seaborn allows the creation of statistical graphics.
It allows comparison between multiple variables , supports multi-plots grids , available univariate and bivariate visualizations.
It  provides different color palettes estimates and plots and linear regression also.
Seaborn functions can also work on dataframes
